# Introduction to data
Data were collected from Scopus in September 2016 and included all records published by Italian sociologists between 2006 and 2015. This period covered five full years before and after ANVUR, whose original call for participation was on 7 November 2011. By considering five years before and after the call, we aimed to trace pre-existing behaviour and examine scientistsâ€™ reactions to institutional policies.
